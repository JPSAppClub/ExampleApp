# JPS App Club: Color "Calculator"
This is an example app used to demonstrate basic Android app development concepts:
  - The MVC model
  - User interface
  - Handling user interaction

The contents of this project might look confusing at first, with no Java file in sight. But don't worry, there are only four files you really need to care about:
- **CalculateActivity.java** (found at **ExampleApp/src/main/java/com/jpsappclub/exampleapp/**)
- **Color.java** (same place)
- **ColorCalculator.java** (same place)
- **activity_calculate.xml** (found at **ExampleApp/app/src/main/res/layout/**)

<p>Each section of the code, and the concepts they embody, are explained in the wiki. Think of it as a textbook of sorts, except with, well, only three pages. Three very useful pages, though.</p>
