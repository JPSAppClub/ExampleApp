# Android Example App: "Color Calculator"
This is an example app that demonstrates basic Android app development concepts:
  - The MVC design pattern
  - User interface
  - Handling user interaction

The contents of this project might look confusing at first, with no Java file in sight. But don't worry, they're there, just tucked away in a bunch of folders. There are only four files you really need to care about:
- **CalculateActivity.java** (found at [/app/src/main/java/com/jpsappclub/exampleapp/](/app/src/main/java/com/jpsappclub/exampleapp))
- **Color.java** (same place)
- **ColorCalculator.java** (same place)
- **activity_calculate.xml** (found at [/app/src/main/res/layout/](/app/src/main/res/layout/))

Each section of the code, and the concepts they embody, are explained in the wiki (https://github.com/JPSAppClub/ExampleApp/wiki). Think of it as a textbook of sorts, except with, well, only three pages. Three very useful pages, though.
