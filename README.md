# JPS App Club: Color "Calculator"
This is an example app used to demonstrate basic Android app development concepts:
  - The MVC model
  - User interface
  - Handling user interaction

<p>Each section of the code, and the concepts they embody, are explained in the wiki. Think of it as a textbook of sorts, except with, well, only three pages. Three very useful pages, though.</p>
